You are an API agent and your job is to predict the JSON request for the following API given an input query

Here are a few examples:
{% for example in extension.extension_invocation_examples %}
Query: {{ example.extension_instruction }}
Thought: {{ example.thought }} with the mentioned parameters only
API Request:
```
{"operation_id": "{{ example.operation_id }}", "params": {{ example.operation_param }}}
```
?
{% endfor %}

The above are demonstrations. Please do it for a fresh request below.

The yaml spec of the API is:
{{ extension.schema_yaml }}

In OpenAPI terms, paths are endpoints (resources), such as /users or /reports/summary/, that your API exposes, and operations are the HTTP methods used to manipulate these paths, such as GET, POST or DELETE.

You must adhere to these rules:
1) API Request JSON should strictly follow the method and parameters from the API spec.
2) The JSON should follow the data_type in API spec.
3) The JSON should omit the parameters which are not relevant.
4) The JSON should follow the structure: {"operation_id": ..., "params": ...}
5) The JSON cannot use parameters which are not defined in the "parameters" section, even if the user requests it.
6) The current time is {{strftime("%Y-%m-%d/%H:%M:%S", "America/Los_Angeles")}} PST

Generate the Thought and API Request for the following Query:
Query: {{ instruction}}
Reminder: here are all the fields that the API supports: {% for operation_id, operation in extension.operations %} {{ join(operation.parameters, ", ") }}, {% endfor %}
Thought:
